<h2 id="about-eaai">About EAAI</h2>
<p>EAAI-26 invites AI educators and researchers to share and discuss advances in AI education. </p>

<h2 id="submission-types">Submission Types</h2>
<p>EAAI-26 features a main track and three special tracks: &quot;Resources for Teaching AI in K-12&quot;, &quot;AI for Education&quot;, and &quot;Model AI Assignments&quot;. All submissions are subject to double-blind review, and all accepted submissions will be presented at the symposium.
</p>
		    
<h3 id="maintrack">Main Track</h3>
<p><em>Chairs: Narges Norouzi (University of California, Berkeley), Lisa Zhang (University of Toronto Mississauga), Bradford Mott (North Carolina State University)</em></p>
<p>The main track invites papers that contribute to advancing AI education and pedagogy. 
	Submissions may be framed as research papers or as experience reports. Potential topics include:
<ul>
    <li>The design of an AI curriculum, course, or module.</li>
    <li>The development and use of a tool or resource to enhance AI students’ learning experiences.</li>
    <li>The impact of a pedagogical or mentoring technique on AI students.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Each paper must be submitted to only one of the contribution areas outlined below. 
	Papers will be reviewed for the area to which they are submitted and will not be moved between areas.
</p>
<p><b>Area 1: Research Papers</b></p>

<p>We invite submissions for Research on advances in AI education. 
	The hallmark of papers in this area is the presence of a research question or hypothesis, 
	along with an extensive evaluation to answer the question, including the use of learning sciences or pedagogical reasoning to demonstrate how research questions enhance educational experiences in AI. 
	Papers in this area will be reviewed based on the clarity of the research questions posed, 
	the soundness of the approaches used to address these questions, and the overall contribution. 
	Both qualitative and quantitative research are welcome.
</p>
		    
<p><b>Area 2: Experience Report and Innovative Practice</b></p>
<p>We invite submissions for the Experience Report Area, which offers educators and researchers the opportunity to share their experiences, 
	observations, insights, and outcomes with the broader AI education community. 
	Papers in this area should describe the development and use of an AI education module, 
	approach, or tool, the context of its use, the data collected, and, importantly, 
	provide a rich reflection on what did or didn’t work and why. 
	Contributions should be motivated by prior literature and highlight the novelty of the experience or tool presented, 
	in addition to the reflection.
</p>

<h3 id="ai4k12">Special Track: Resources for Teaching AI in K-12</h3>
<p><em>Chairs: Kate Moore (MIT), Amy Eguchi (UC San Diego)</em></p>
<p>This special track invites papers on the development and use of resources to support K-12 AI education. 
	Examples include online demos, software tools, and structured activities. 
	Submissions should follow the standard EAAI format for an academic paper and include the following: 
	description of the resource; target age group and context; setup and resources required; AI concepts addressed; 
	expected learning outcomes; and (if possible) implementation results. 
	Online demos and software tools should be accompanied by brief video walk-throughs. 
</p>
		    
<h3 id="ai4education">Special Track: AI for Education</h3>
<p><em>Chairs: Oscar Karnalim (Universitas Kristen Maranatha Bandung), Michael Liut (University of Toronto Mississauga)</em></p>
<p>Educational domains offer distinct task areas and challenges for AI, 
	as well as unique opportunities for positive impact. 
	This special track invites research on advances in AI applied to educational tasks and domains, 
	including novel student models, intelligent learning environments, automated assistants, and instructional support. 
	Submissions should be framed as research publications or experience reports consistent with the general call.
</p>
		    
		    
<h3 id="modelai">Special Track: Model AI Assignments </h3>
<p><em>Chair: Todd Neller (Gettysburg College)</em></p>
<p>This special track invites assignments for AI classes. Good assignments take a lot of work to design. If an assignment you have developed may be useful to other AI educators, 
	this track provides an opportunity to share it. Model AI Assignments are kept in a public online archive.</p>
<p>This track has special submission instructions (<a href="http://modelai.gettysburg.edu">http://modelai.gettysburg.edu</a>).</p>
		    
		    
<h2 id="review-criteria">Review Criteria</h2>
<p>Submissions will be reviewed for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relevance to the track</li>
<li>Significance to the intended audience</li>
<li>Engagement with prior work</li>
<li>Novelty of contributions</li>
<li>Technical soundness</li>
<li>Clarity of presentation</li>
<li>Evaluation of claims/results (as applicable)</li>
<li>Engagement with questions of ethics/inclusivity (as applicable)</li>
</ul>
<p>
For <strong>empirical studies</strong>, we suggest that authors consider making use of one of the reporting standards in the SIGSOFT Empirical Standards document (<a href="https://acmsigsoft.github.io/EmpiricalStandards/docs">https://acmsigsoft.github.io/EmpiricalStandards/docs</a>). This is not mandatory, and submissions not making use of the reporting standards will not be penalized.  Notwithstanding, we always aim for high standards in empirical research.  Specifically making use of the SIGSOFT Empirical Standards criteria allows us to hold all authors to the same high standards. Every paper is considered on its own merits, and we recognize that deviation from the guidelines may sometimes be desirable. 
</p>
		    
		    
		    
<h2 id="submission-instructions">Submission Instructions</h2>
<p>All submissions (including supplementary materials) must be anonymous for double-blind review.</p>
<p>Instructions for paper submissions (all tracks except Model AI Assignments, which have their own format):</p>
	<ul>	<li>Papers should be up to 7 pages long, plus up to 2 pages of references.</li>
		<li>Use the <a href="https://aaai.org/authorkit26/">AAAI-26 Author Kit</a>.</li>
		<li>For supplementary material follow the AAAI-26 Supplementary Material Guide.   </li>
		<li>Submit papers via EasyChair (<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eaai26">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eaai26</a>).</li>
	</ul>
		    
<p>EAAI-26 will not consider any paper that, at the time of submission, is under review for or has already been published or accepted for publication in a refereed journal or conference. 
	Once submitted to EAAI-26, papers may not be submitted to another refereed journal or conference during the review period. 
	These restrictions do not apply to unrefereed forums or workshops without archival proceedings.</p>
