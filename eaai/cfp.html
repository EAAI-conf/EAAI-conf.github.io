<h2 id="about-eaai">About EAAI</h2>
<p>EAAI-25 invites AI educators and researchers to share and discuss advances in AI education. </p>

<h2 id="submission-types">Submission Types</h2>
<p>EAAI-25 has a main track and two special tracks. All submissions are subject to double-blind review. All accepted submissions are to be presented at the symposium.</p>
		    
<h3 id="maintrack">Main Track</h3>
<p><em>Chairs: Fred Martin (University of Texas at San Antonio), Narges Norouzi (University of California Berkeley), Effat Farhana (Vanderbilt University)</em></p>
<p>The main track invites papers that contribute to advancing AI education and pedagogy. 
	Submissions may be framed as research papers or as experience reports. Potential topics include:
<ul>
    <li>The design of an AI curriculum, course, or module.</li>
    <li>The development and use of a tool or resource to enhance learning experiences.</li>
    <li>The impact of a pedagogical or mentoring technique on AI students.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Each paper must be submitted to only one of the contribution areas outlined below. 
	Papers will be reviewed for the area they are submitted to, and they will not be moved between the areas.
</p>
<p><b>Area 1: Research Papers</b></p>

<p>We invite submissions for Research on advances in AI education. 
	The hallmark of papers in this area is the presence of a research question or hypothesis and the extensive evaluation 
	to answer the question, including the use of learning sciences or pedagogical reasoning to show why research questions 
	improve educational experiences. Papers in this area will be reviewed based on the clarity of the research questions posed, 
	the soundness of the approaches to address the questions posed, and the overall contribution. 
	Both qualitative and quantitative research are welcomed.
</p>
		    
<p><b>Area 2: Experience Report and Innovative Practice</b></p>
<p>We invite submissions for the Experience Report Area, which provides an opportunity for educators and researchers to share 
	their experiences, observations, insights, and outcomes with the broader AI education community. 
	Papers in this area should describe the development and use of an AI education module, approach, or tool, 
	the context of its use, the data collected, and, importantly, provide a rich reflection on what did or 
	didn’t work and why. Contributions should be motivated by prior literature, and should highlight the novelty 
	of the experience or tool presented in addition to the reflection.
</p>

<h3 id="ai4k12">Special Track: Resources for Teaching AI in K-12</h3>
<p><em>Chairs: Dave Touretzky (Carnegie Mellon), Christina Gardner-McCune (University of Florida), Kate Moore (MIT)</em></p>
<p>This special track invites papers on the development and use of resources to support K-12 AI education. 
	Examples include online demos, software tools, and structured activities. Submissions should follow the standard 
	EAAI format for an academic paper and include the following: description of the resource; target age group; 
	setup and resources needed; AI concepts addressed; expected learning outcomes; and (if possible) implementation results. 
	Online demos and software tools should be accompanied by brief video walk-throughs.</p>
		    
<!--<h3 id="mentored">Special Track: Mentored Undergraduate Research Challenge: AI for Accessibility in Communication</h3>
<p><em>Chair: Rick Freedman (SIFT)</em></p>
<p>This special track invites papers addressing the AI for Accessibility in Communication Mentored Undergraduate Research Challenge. The objective of this year's challenge is to perform and publish research on the development or application of AI that makes sharing information more approachable and inclusive. The broader purpose of EAAI mentored undergraduate research challenges is to encourage undergraduate students to experience the full life-cycle of AI research through the guidance of a mentor familiar with the research life-cycle.</p>
<p>Submissions should be framed as research papers, with at least one undergraduate (including community college) student author and at least one mentor (faculty or Ph.D.-holding) author.</p>
<p>This track has special instructions and support (<a href="https://www.yetanotherfreedman.com/resources/challenge_ai4aic.html">https://www.yetanotherfreedman.com/resources/challenge_ai4aic.html</a>).</p>
-->
		    
<h3 id="modelai">Special Track: Model AI Assignments </h3>
<p><em>Chair: Todd Neller (Gettysburg College)</em></p>
<p>This special track invites assignments for AI classes. Good assignments take a lot of work to design. If an assignment you have developed may be useful to other AI educators, this track provides an opportunity to share it. Model AI Assignments are kept in a public online archive.</p>
<p>This track has special submission instructions (<a href="http://modelai.gettysburg.edu">http://modelai.gettysburg.edu</a>).</p>
		    
		    
<h2 id="review-criteria">Review Criteria</h2>
<p>Submissions will be reviewed for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relevance to the track</li>
<li>Significance to the intended audience</li>
<li>Engagement with prior work</li>
<li>Novelty of contributions</li>
<li>Technical soundness</li>
<li>Clarity of presentation</li>
<li>Evaluation of claims/results (as applicable)</li>
<li>Engagement with questions of ethics/inclusivity (as applicable)</li>
</ul>
<p>
For <strong>empirical studies</strong>, we suggest that authors consider making use of one of the reporting standards in the SIGSOFT Empirical Standards document (<a href="https://acmsigsoft.github.io/EmpiricalStandards/docs">https://acmsigsoft.github.io/EmpiricalStandards/docs</a>). This is not mandatory, and submissions not making use of the reporting standards will not be penalized.  Notwithstanding, we always aim for high standards in empirical research.  Specifically making use of the SIGSOFT Empirical Standards criteria allows us to hold all authors to the same high standards. Every paper is considered on its own merits, and we recognize that deviation from the guidelines may sometimes be desirable. 
</p>
		    
		    
		    
<h2 id="submission-instructions">Submission Instructions</h2>
<p>All submissions (including supplementary materials) must be anonymous for double-blind review.</p>
<p>Instructions for paper submissions (all tracks except Model AI Assignments, which have their own format):</p>
	<ul>	<li>Papers should be up to 7 pages long, plus up to 2 pages of references.</li>
		<li>Use the <a href="https://aaai.org/authorkit25/">AAAI-25 Author Kit</a>.</li>
		<li>For supplementary material follow the AAAI-25 Supplementary Material Guide.   </li>
		<li>Submit papers via EasyChair (<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eaai25">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eaai25</a>).</li>
	</ul>
		    
<p>EAAI-24 will not consider any paper that, at the time of submission, is under review for or has already been published or accepted for publication in a refereed journal or conference. Once submitted to EAAI-24, papers may not be submitted to another refereed journal or conference during the review period. These restrictions do not apply to unrefereed forums or workshops without archival proceedings.</p>
